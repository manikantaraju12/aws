#Real-Time Fraud Detection in Online Transactions

Project Overview

This project implements a real-time fraud detection system for online financial transactions using Amazon Web Services (AWS).
It leverages Amazon Fraud Detector along with other AWS services to analyze transactions, detect suspicious patterns, and trigger alerts instantly.
Fraudulent transactions are flagged based on machine learning models and predefined rules, ensuring enhanced security, scalability, and trust for online payments.

System Architecture

The architecture integrates multiple AWS services to process, analyze, and respond to fraud attempts in real-time.
Flow:
Transactions are streamed via Amazon Kinesis.
Processed using AWS Lambda.
Evaluated by Amazon Fraud Detector.
Results stored in DynamoDB and alerts sent via Amazon SNS.
Monitoring handled by Amazon CloudWatch.

AWS Services Used

The system leverages several AWS services in an integrated pipeline. Amazon Fraud Detector provides ML-based fraud detection, while Amazon Kinesis enables real-time transaction streaming. AWS Lambda executes the fraud detection logic, and Amazon SNS delivers instant SMS or email alerts when suspicious activity is detected. Detected transactions are stored in Amazon DynamoDB, and datasets and logs are maintained in Amazon S3. Finally, Amazon CloudWatch ensures continuous monitoring and logging of the entire workflow.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how AWS services can be orchestrated to build a real-time fraud detection system that is serverless, scalable, and reliable. By combining Amazon Fraud Detector with Kinesis, Lambda, DynamoDB, SNS, S3, and CloudWatch, the solution effectively detects fraudulent transactions, triggers instant alerts, and ensures continuous monitoring. With further enhancements like biometric verification or advanced anomaly detection, the system can be extended into a comprehensive fraud prevention platform for modern financial applications.
